# Config file collection

A collection of my dotfiles. Mainly for my own use, but feel free to use them as you please. If you find mistakes or things that could be improved, please, open a pull request!

Directories are such that copying them to `~/.config/` will do the job.

It's been a while and these things may well be outdated!
